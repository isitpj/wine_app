This is a bot to help you with your wine life. Super simple at the moment. For now, basic setup - clone repo, you will need ngrok to test locally. Run `./ngrok http 3000` after launching a server on port 3000 to get the bot up and running. You will also need to update the ngrok tunnel url and re-enter the verify token from the config.yaml file. This can be done at the webhooks page for the app, by clicking on the edit subscription button. Make getting going again next time much easier. Well done good documentation me.
