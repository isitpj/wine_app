This is a bot to help you with your wine life. Super simple at the moment. For now, basic setup - clone repo, you will need ngrok to test locally. Run `foreman start` followed by `./ngrok http 3000`to get the bot up and running. Webviews can be accessed on port 5000. You will also need to update the ngrok tunnel url and re-enter the verify token from the .env file. This can be done at the webhooks page for the app, by clicking on the edit subscription button.
